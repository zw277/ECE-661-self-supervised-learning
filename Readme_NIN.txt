Due to the upload size limited, I can only submit the code, if further model is needed, feel free to contact me with email!


'NIN_Pretrain.ipynb': trained the unsupervised NIN with 4 blocks
'Fully_supervised_NIN.ipynb: the notebook for training on the base line NIN
'NIN_test.ipynb': notebook doing nearly all the test around NIN(depth research & label testing)

Note that the NIN structure and conv classifier code in above notebooks are the source code from the essay https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07728.pdf
