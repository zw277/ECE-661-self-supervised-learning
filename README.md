# ECE-661-self-supervised-learning

For SimCLR model pretrain and linear evaluation, please refer to `simclr_res50.ipynb`, `simclr_res50_2.ipynb`, `resnet_20.ipynb`,`linear_evaluation.ipynb` the settings of training model with batch size 64, 128, 256 can be changed by simply changing the batch size in trainloader and testloader.

For RotNet model pretrain, please refer to  `Full_supervised_NIN.pth`, `NIN_Pretrain.ipynb`, `NIN_test.ipynb`, `readme.NIN.txt`

For fine-tune SimCLR and RotNet and model performance compare, please refer to `rotnet_resnet_20.ipynb` and `simclr_semi.ipynb`
Due to the upload size limited, We can only submit the code, if pretrained, fine-tuned models are needed, feel free to contact us via email!
