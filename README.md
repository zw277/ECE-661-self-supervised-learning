For SimCLR model and linear evaluation, please refer to `simclr_res50_pretrain.ipynb`, `linear_evaluation.ipynb` the settings of training model with batch size 64, 128, 256 can be changed by simply changing the batch size in trainloader and testloader.

For RotNet model, please refer to  `Full_supervised_NIN.pth`, `NIN_Pretrain.ipynb`, `NIN_test.ipynb`, `readme.NIN.txt`

Due to the upload size limited, We can only submit the code, if pretrained, fine-tuned models are needed, feel free to contact us via email!
